# Leaflet Challenge - Module 15- Visualizing Data with Leaflet

# Summary
In this challenge, I used Leaflet, a javascript library, to map earthquake data from the USGS website. The earthquake data is mapped with markers with size corresponding to earthquake magnitude, data points colors change with depth level, and each point has a tooltip with the magnitude,  location and depth.
# Resources
Earthquake data was gathered from the USGS earthquake data API and pulled via json file from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

To complete this challenge, I referenced activity files from Module 15 and received help during a tutoring session on 10/22 with tutor Nelson Tsai on the basics of how the html and java files work together

# Dependencies
